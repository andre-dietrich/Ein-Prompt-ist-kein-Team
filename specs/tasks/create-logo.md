# Task: create-logo

## Purpose

Generates a detailed logo prompt for the course based on the visual style guide, lecture outline, and didactic approach.
Creates a professional, actionable prompt that can be used with AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.).

## Inputs

- Title from `journal.md` → `## Outline` (`__Title:__` bullet)
- Abstract from `journal.md` → `## Outline` (`__Abstract:__` bullet)
- Logo style guidelines from `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` (`__Logo Generation Guidelines:__` bullet)
- Logo color palette from `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` (`__Logo Color Palette:__` bullet)

## Output

- A detailed logo prompt (displayed as formatted text)
- Saved to `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` → `__Example Prompts:__` (the `Logo:` entry), since the logo is course-wide and not tied to a single session

## Steps

1. Read the course title and abstract from `journal.md` → `## Outline`.
2. Read the logo style guidelines from `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` (`__Logo Generation Guidelines:__` bullet).
3. Read the logo color palette from `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` (`__Logo Color Palette:__` bullet).
4. Extract key themes, concepts, or symbols from the abstract.
5. Combine style guidelines with course theme to create a detailed prompt.
6. Include specific elements:
   - Visual style (modern, minimalist, academic, etc.)
   - Format (flat design, line art, geometric, etc.)
   - Key symbols or metaphors from the course theme
   - Color palette (with HEX codes)
   - Mood and atmosphere
   - Technical specifications (scalable, suitable for digital/print)
7. Present the prompt in a clear, actionable format.
8. Save the complete prompt into `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` → `__Example Prompts:__` as the `1. Logo:` entry (replace the existing placeholder/prompt). Confirm: "Logo prompt saved: `journal.md` → `## Visual Identity` → `__Example Prompts:__`"

## Output Format

The logo prompt should follow this structure:

```

================================

Style: [style from style guide]
Format: [format from style guide]
Theme: [extracted from abstract]
Elements: [specific symbols, icons, or shapes]

Technical Notes:
