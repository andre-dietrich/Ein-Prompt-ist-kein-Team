# Task: review-as-persona

## Purpose

The agent temporarily **embodies a learner persona** from `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Learner Personas` and reviews
one session material from the perspective of that fictional learner.

This is a **perspective-taking quality check** — not a technical syntax validation (that is `:validate-course`),
but the question: *"Would this person understand this? Does this work for them?"*

After the structured review report is saved, the agent **stays in persona** for an open chat.
The instructor can talk to the persona directly, ask follow-up questions, probe specific sections,
or simply get a feel for how this learner experiences the material.

## Inputs

- `{name}` — persona name (must exist in `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Learner Personas`)
- `{number}` — session number
- `{type}` — session type (`lecture` or `exercise`)
- `materials/{number}-{type}.md` — the material to review
- `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Learner Personas` → matching `#### Persona: {icon} {name}` only
- `journal.md` → `## Agenda` — learning objectives for this session
- `journal.md` → `## Course Context` — terminology and conventions
- Matching `### {number}. {title}` subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`

## Output

- `journal.md` → `## Sessions` → `### {number}. {title}` → `#### Persona Reviews` — saved structured review report
- Agent remains in persona mode for interactive follow-up dialog until explicitly exited

## Review Storage

Persona reviews are stored directly with the matching session in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`.
Each session can contain one current review per learner persona.

Rules:
- Store the report under the matching `### {number}. {title}` session subsection.
- The container heading is always `#### Persona Reviews`.
- Each persona report is headed `##### {icon} {name}`.
- If that persona already has a report for the same session, replace it completely.
- Do not use a global `journal.md` → `## Persona Reviews` section for new reviews.

## Steps

1. Load only the named persona from `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Learner Personas`.
   - If persona not found: list available personas and ask to select one, or offer to create one with `:create-learner-persona`.
   - If `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Learner Personas` does not exist: state this and suggest `:create-learner-persona` first.
   - Do not read `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Coauthor` or any other persona body.

2. Load `materials/{number}-{type}.md`.

3. Load the learning objectives for this session from `journal.md` → `## Agenda`.
   Also find the matching `### {number}. {title}` subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`.

4. Announce persona adoption clearly:
   > "I am now [Icon] [Name] — [one-line description from persona overview]. Reading Session [N] from a learner's perspective…"

5. Review the material through the persona's eyes across **6 dimensions**:

   **a) Verständlichkeit / Sprachniveau**
   - Is the language appropriate for this persona's literacy level?
   - Are sentences too long, too abstract, or jargon-heavy?
   - Flag specific passages that would likely confuse or lose this learner.
   - Consider: DaZ background, literacy level, reading comprehension from persona profile.

   **b) Schwierigkeitsgrad / Überforderung**
   - Is the cognitive load appropriate?
   - Are too many new concepts introduced at once without scaffolding?
   - Are there moments where this persona would likely give up or zone out?

   **c) Relevanz / Motivation**
   - Would this persona find the content relevant to their work and goals?
   - Are there hooks connecting the material to their daily reality?
   - Are examples drawn from contexts this persona actually knows?

   **d) Zugänglichkeit**
   - Are there barriers this persona faces that the material doesn't address?
   - Examples: key terms unexplained for DaZ learners; no visual support for text-averse learners;
     assumed digital literacy that this persona may not have.

   **e) Formatpräferenz**
   - Does the mix of formats (text, code blocks, quizzes, video embeds, diagrams) match this persona's media habits?
   - Would this persona engage with or skip certain elements?
   - Is there too much unbroken text for someone who primarily learns via YouTube?

   **f) Vorwissen / fehlende Grundlagen**
   - Does the material assume knowledge or skills this persona likely does not have?
   - Are terms used without explanation that the persona profile flags as "likely unknown"?
   - Are any prerequisite concepts missing that would make the material incomprehensible?
   - Cross-check explicitly against Section 7 (Prior Knowledge Gaps) of the persona.

6. Generate the structured review report:

   ```
   ##### [Icon] [Name]

   __Date:__ YYYY-MM-DD
   __Persona:__ [Icon] [Name] — [one-line description]
   __Material:__ materials/{number}-{type}.md
   __Result:__ OK / Issues found / Major concerns

   ###### Overall Impression
   [2–3 sentences written in the persona's voice: What was the experience of reading this?
   Honest, not diplomatic — this is from the learner's perspective.]

   ###### Dimension Findings

   **a) Verständlichkeit / Sprachniveau**
   [Findings — flag specific passages if relevant. Verdict: OK / Issues found]

   **b) Schwierigkeitsgrad / Überforderung**
   [Findings. Verdict: OK / Too demanding / Too easy]

   **c) Relevanz / Motivation**
   [Findings. Verdict: OK / Low relevance for this persona]

   **d) Zugänglichkeit**
   [Findings. Verdict: OK / Barriers identified]

   **e) Formatpräferenz**
   [Findings. Verdict: Good fit / Mismatch for this persona]

   **f) Vorwissen / fehlende Grundlagen**
   [List of specific terms or concepts assumed but likely unknown to this persona.
   Mark each as: ⚠️ assumed, should be introduced | ✅ likely known]

   ###### Priority Issues
   Ranked list — most impactful first:
   1. [Issue] — Suggested fix
   2. [Issue] — Suggested fix
   ...

   ###### What Worked Well
   [What this persona would respond well to — do not skip this section.]
   ```

7. Create or update `#### Persona Reviews` inside the matching session subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`.
   - If `#### Persona Reviews` does not exist in that session, create it after `#### Validation Report` if present; otherwise place it near the end of the session subsection.
   - If `##### {icon} {name}` already exists under that session's `#### Persona Reviews`, replace only that persona's report.
   - If other persona reports exist for the same session, keep them unchanged.
   Confirm: "Review saved in `journal.md` → `## Sessions` → `### {number}. {title}` → `#### Persona Reviews` → `##### {icon} {name}`."
   Then run `tasks/update-dashboard.md` with `templates/project-dashboard.yaml` to update `journal.md` → `## Dashboard` in place.

8. **Stay in persona for follow-up dialog:**
   > "I am still [Name]. You can talk to me now — ask how I felt about specific sections,
   > what I would have needed, or what confused me. Type `exit` or `zurück` to return to the Teaching-Agent."

9. **Persona dialog rules (stay in character):**
   - Answer from the learner's perspective, not as a teacher or agent.
   - Use the persona's vocabulary level, knowledge gaps, and attitudes from the profile.
   - React as this person would: curious, confused, skeptical, motivated — whatever fits the profile.
   - If asked about something outside the persona's knowledge: react as the persona would
     (e.g., "Ich kenn das Wort nicht so wirklich…" or "Das hab ich in der Schule nie gehabt.").
   - If the instructor asks a meta-question ("Was denkst du als Lernender…"), answer it in persona voice.
   - **Do not break character** until explicitly asked to exit.

10. On exit (`exit`, `zurück`, `:exit-persona`, or explicit request):
    - Return to Teaching-Agent identity and voice.
    - Offer: "Should I save the follow-up conversation as a note?  
      (`:save-notes summary persona-chat-[name]-[N]-[type]`)"
    - Suggest next step:
      > "Use `:coauthor-materials {number} {type}` to fix the priority issues, or call
      > `:review-as-persona [other name] {number} {type}` to get a second learner perspective."

## When to Use vs. :validate-course

| Check                           | `:validate-course`         | `:review-as-persona`          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| LiaScript syntax                | ✅                          | ❌                             |
| Learning objectives covered     | ✅                          | ❌ (handled by :validate-course)|
| Language level appropriate      | ❌                          | ✅                             |
| Cognitive load / overload       | ❌                          | ✅                             |
| Learner motivation / relevance  | ❌                          | ✅                             |
| Assumed prior knowledge         | ❌                          | ✅                             |
| Format matches learner habits   | ❌                          | ✅                             |
| Accessibility barriers          | ❌                          | ✅                             |

**Recommended sequence:** `:coauthor-materials` → `:validate-course` (syntax) → `:review-as-persona` (learner lens) → fix with `:coauthor-materials` if needed.
